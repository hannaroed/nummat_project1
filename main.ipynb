This means that the forward and inverse DFTs have the same form, which simplifies proofs and calculations. Also the scaling preserves the norm of the vector, meaning that the transformation does not amplify or reduce the energy (norm) of the signal. Moreover, with the scaling factor $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} $, the matrix $ \\mathcal{F}_N $ becomes an orthogonal matrix (up to a complex conjugate), which means $ \\mathcal{F}_N \\mathcal{F}_N^* = \\mathbf{I}_N $.
